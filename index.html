        <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The subject of my research around archives is influenced by new digital means of recording and preserving — following the concept of archiving in the 'digital space' and the question of how to think about different technology tools and platforms as a way to archive. My thesis is focusing on how digital preservation can lead to a deeper understanding of works of art and cultural heritage and what impact on the meaning the relocation of the artefacts has. I see archiving and documenting as an act against the fading of memory and history. Often archives are closed physical spaces that separate themselves from the outside world. The exclusivity creates an unbalance which opens the question of how the act of archiving can become collective. Collecting, storing, and analysing has always been part of our society and I see a strong connection to the profession as a Graphic Designer. However, the distinction to an actual archivist is in creating a coherent narrative. The responsibility to transform and communicate information to a visual message influences the means of storing knowledge. With this thesis, I would like to discover the role of graphic design in digital conservation and its role in transmitting knowledge to future generations.<br />
Design as a practice is growing into immersive directions. It is a viscous environment with multiple directions to hop on to. And as one finds themselves in this gluey mass, going back and forth between digital and physical, between past and future one navigates the observer through a labyrinth of possibilities. The design practice provides a space for doing research, creating, and reflecting. It comes with a lot of freedom but on the contrary also responsibilities. Building archives around topics and objects, diving into the ocean of knowledge, and looking for treasures of the forgotten. The Iranian artist, writer, and activist Morehshin Allahyari brings back what was thought to be lost with a form of practice to go back and forth between digital and physical. These alternative forms of archiving and transmitting knowledge were guiding me through the labyrinths of technological possibilities. With the metamorphosis and the constant adaptions to our surroundings, I wonder if technology and design can help us to understand these changes and build an in-depth layered archive that provides access to inaccessible sites. Thinking about reviving archives, a physical archive is a way to explore possible hardware and tools which are used for digitizing and bringing them back to life. However, I see archiving not only in its classic way, but I would also like to investigate in different directions finding forms of archiving which adapted to the metamorphosed world. Seeing it from a different perspective opens new possibilities to link an archive to something in flux – one that, is adapting to its surroundings and circumstances.</p>    </div>

 <h1>01</h1>
<h2>Haptic Memory</h2>
<h3>Epitome of Storage</h3>
<p>The term archive is polysemy and solicits several answers.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">[1]</a></sup> In general, they are defined by their context but range from the physical building or location to the collection of documents. Further, it can define as more complex, in which it refers more to the act itself. The working process of creating, structuring and recording documents and records. All in all, concrete structures are bound to reality and physicality. The French philosopher Michel Foucault comments in his book <em>Archaeology of Knowledge</em> that archives have certain flexibility. In his words: “It emerges in fragments, regions, and levels.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">[2]</a></sup> To look at the whole and in its totality rather than each section. The archive itself can’t be seen as something flat and one-dimensional. With each new entity, a new direction is formed. A new branch to climb on and follow its direction until its crosses another branch. This form of growing and dwindling as a tree renews itself every spring reflects the flexibility of an archive. The documents contained in an archive can travel through different storage, be re-contextualized, be outsourced, and destroyed in a later process to make space for something new. And just as the tree needs to adapt to its surroundings and might overcome obstacles, the archives are in flux too. In a constant adaption to the surrounding and current situation. They aren't fixed or entirely stable and wrap themselves around each new possible future presented to them. The newest future it is facing came with the emergence of new technologies. Increasing the possibilities of fragmenting the documents and records once entering the data flow. </p>
<h3>Church, Palace &amp; Museum</h3>
<p>The phone as my little palace. It is mostly only me looking at the presented. Every day something new, always presented in the same frame. On my expedition through the unknown, I collect and preserve. The collection of saved treasures is only presented to me and so it was in ancient times. It feels as jumping back in time and looking onto the packed walls of *Ole Worm's cabinet of curiosities. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">[3]</a></sup>  All these creatures and objects from unknown places might have never seen someone else than the wrongful owner or his chosen selection. All the plundered treasures could not be presented to the public. And so, they found their way into enclosed spaces only accessible to the chosen. The traditional way of depicting art in churches, palaces, and private collections shows the still common concept of art which assumes that the art system crates orders and hierarchies that give value to the art. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">[4]</a></sup> The work of art is valuable because it is depicted in a place with a higher ranking. The difference between the space outside of the museum, which one can consider real life, and the institution, creates an exclusion. The modern museum as a closed-up bight space separates itself from the outside world. “In this sense, the modern museum is the successor of the church and the monastery.”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Relation to Time and Space</h3>
<p>New processes and production methods create a new style of content that relates to time and space alternates. With one click one can access a full ocean of information, surfing the internet and climbing up heaps of information. It affects the content of what is created, produced, and archived. Our everyday life is determined by archiving and everyone can be — or is unconscious — an archivist.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">[6]</a></sup> The constant mode of archiving took over and lets one create an accumulation of information on their own. Everything in a second and in one click. Thinking of social media platforms and other digital archival platforms, the number of archival documents uploaded creates an enormous, flexible system. The act behind archiving doesn't only an individual method but becomes a collective project. The rethinking of archiving to an open, collaborative, and creative act allows new voices. The emergence of new technologies brought this rethinking of the term. However, I see the human as an important figure in the creation and act of archiving to create new possible futures.</p>
<h3>Metamorphosis</h3>
<p>Sci-fi sounds and flickering lights flash from my screen. A tunnel of white gloomy light forms the way to another sphere and with the explosion of bright light, a new kind of universe appears. Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem is a musical film that shows the tracks of the French duo Daft Punk.  The story is underlaid with their sounds telling the story of a kidnapped alien band. An implanted mind controller tells the character to be "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”. This scenario could describe today's world, which is becoming faster and faster. With a loud bang the technological revolution brought an acceleration of change. The metamorphosis of humankind started to take on speed.</p>
<p>In a certain way, we are interwoven with technology. It became over time more and more clear that the interaction and care we have towards technology creates a relation. One wouldn’t speak of implantation, but technical devices stick to us, and we cannot say that there is something neutral in front of us when we hold any technical device such as our smartphone. Already the part <em>smart</em> in the name implies we have something with moral baggage facing us. It has changed our society and how we understand the world. Seeing everything through technological lenses comes with a danger of our existence and here not in a physical sense but a conceptual sense. With this, I mean the thought of seeing technology as a revelation, as a way and means of understanding rather than just a neutral tool. Bringing this together with the definition of an archive the meaning can transform into something more than only a collection. With the speed of our time, the archive becomes an ever-evolving platform, where new forms of documenting and cataloguing arise with new archival approaches. I like to see technology as an interruption of the time flow, where we can go back in time and into the future. The same way as an archive is bridging the historical and the utopian/dystopian. Thinking of the past as an accumulation of historical records. Preserved in its materials, which can be shared with others and communicated to future generations we can study past scenes and movements. Telling us what futures we will live in the future.</p>
<h3>The darkness of the Museum</h3>
<p>The identification of the museum and other art collections is an institution of memory. A place in flux, constantly losing and regaining form, a never coming to an end of history. The stories are sticking to things that are considered relevant and brought to the museum. Willing to transmit this knowledge, the museum has a certain image to the outside where the interior comes with rules one must obey: “do not touch the objects which are displayed, keep distance to them, do not disassemble them, do not examine them closely.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">[7]</a></sup> One is only allowed to look at them. A museum is a place of contemplation. By this, the museums enter some sort of pure enlightenment. And in paradox way, talking about the metaphorical sense of transmitting information and enlightening someone, the museum has always been a bright place itself. In which dark, old, and mystic were brought to be observed. To do so there was a need for light and brightness to let objects come back to life. The tools artists were working with to prove their skills and professionalism, were paint, marble, and wood. They were creating paintings or sculptures down to the smallest detail. This love for refined details became slowly less until one was standing in front of a dark, space (i.g. <em>Malevich's Black Square</em>).  This reduction of possibilities for the artwork transformed the museum and it got a new (outer) glow. This glow is defined by the new means of how artists are demonstrating their technical skill in dealing with computers and other wonderful devices of the kind. The new black squares needed a new environment to let their outer glow shine on the viewer's face. Today’s museum has been darkened by the advent of new forms of art. The newer media art is brought to the museum, the darker the inside becomes. To see someone's video work (or any other digital artwork) the observer needs to sit in the dark, only grasping its poorly enlightened surroundings. The artworks themselves produce light and shine like glowing dream images in the museum's darkness.</p>

<h2>Re-visioning</h2>
<h3>Time Capsule for the Future</h3>
<p>The author Kenneth Goldsmith defines archiving as an act of folk art such as quilting: “Like quilting, archiving employs the obsessive stitching together of many small found pieces into a larger vision, a personal attempt at ordering a chaotic world.”[8] The thought behind stitching together small pieces, such as pieces of fabric in the creation of a quilt, makes the act quite symbolic and meaningful. I see the profession of a designer and with it the responsibility to organize the hump of trash the chaotic world leaves behind. The desire to organize and communicate is embedded in our society for a long time I believe.</p>
<p>Thinking of how much the act of collecting, creating, and archiving is interwoven/stitched in our daily life it can be just approved that everyone is an archivist everywhere. Further, Goldsmith adds he spends “much more time acquiring, cataloging, and archiving ... [his] artifacts these days than ... [he does] engaging with them.”[9] The question after the how matters more and with the digitalization, the inversion of consuming the artifacts increased. How can we shift the focus back to the artifacts or moreover to what they want to tell? I think the profession of designers can function to build narrations around cultural heritage and historical heritage which are endangered — in multiple ways. Of course, you can't fully rebuild what is lost but the relation of digital storage and archiving to human memory creates resources, a kind of time capsule for the future.</p>
<h3>Shaping of Knowledge</h3>
<p>As some museums still follow the classic sense of displaying objects others try to attract the visitor with anomalous structures or highlights. They become a sort of attraction in themselves. The age of experience makes museums places of attraction. Throughout time not only artists and designers have been adapting to the new but also the museum. They have been actively shaping knowledge during their long existence. The structure of knowledge and production of stories through material things, whether natural or artificial have been ways in which it has been possible to know the world. Within each space, the context of the objects has always been re-constructed. Arranging the containing objects and comparing them assists to make the world intelligible. It enabled different possibilities of knowing according to the specific time and space. Today, Museums are organized according to the experience. The visitor wants to discover, interact, and get taken into the world of simulates. Small pieces are constructing new knowledge, carrying it out into the world. The constructions from objects are many, variable and fragile. Meanings are in flux; they can be always taken on and the construction of them can be re-modeled put into a new context and with new functions. “As long as museums and galleries remain the repositories of artifacts and specimens, new relationships can always be built, new meanings can always be discovered, new interpretations with new relevances can be found, new codes and new rules can be written.”[10]</p>
<h3>Re-Figuration</h3>
<p>Once formed and created out of Marble the Roman-era sculpture of King Uthal - الملك اثلو, Known as King of Hatra - مل ك محج و ل اسلا was standing in the Mosul Museum until its destruction in 2015 by the so-called Islamic State. What was thought to be lost forever in the ruins of Mosul found a way back to life in a new form and materiality. Flashy blue and white laser sparkle let the King arise out of the ruins. In the work <em>Material Speculation: ISIS (2015-16</em>) the Iranian artist, writer, and activist Morehshin Allahyari built an archive of around 12 artifacts which got destroyed by ISIS in January 2015. Layer by layer the 3D printer is re-modeling the statue out of plastic resin. His new materiality doesn’t bring back the real statue of King Uthal but it brings with it other benefits. In his body, he carries a memory card containing information on his name, history, and his background. Further, the card delivers detailed images and video footage of the destruction and the .obj and .stl file of the King Uthal statue. Allahyari made the 3D files and the records of her research available for download and created with it open-source access to the entirely deprived heritage. Whoever has access to the world wide web and a 3D printer has now to chance to dive into the world of King Uthal, re-figure him and his story. And even if the 3d file of this statue is online and available to everyone who has access to the internet, the work of Allahyari didn't find a fixed place yet. She is still working on finding the right platform and/or Museum for displaying <em>Material Speculation: ISIS (2015-2016).</em></p>
<p>Allahyari uses re-figuring as a form of activist practice. For her “Re-Figuring […] is about activation and preservation. It’s an act of going back and retrieving the past. How can we re-imagine another kind of present and future through re-imagining the past—especially the kind of past that is forgotten or misrepresented?”[11] The act of <em>re-figuration</em> comprises a deep understanding of the figures in a non-linear direction, where it is about finding other interpretations in other cultures. It has something magical to me traveling back in time and connecting all different points and re-figuring a new world. It is a sign of revival; it is an act to materialize stories that were silenced and make them visible again.</p>
<p>It is a different form of archiving, in which the artifacts are fixed to neither one position nor its form. This flexibility creates a continuum of the archive in which the sequence is spreading into various directions Allahyari has a strong interest in alternative, poetic, and practical forms of archiving. She points out what makes archiving remarkable for her:” hoping those who come after us will know and remember this past and our stories.” [12] The term re-figuration creates a hybrid of two words, a recreation of something existing. Made up out of the prefix and a verb, the former is placed at the beginning of the other word to change its meaning. The repetition or backward motion is indicated by the translation in Latin “again” or “again and again”. Going back to the origin of a topic, re-creating different narratives, and communicating different pieces of information is linked to the profession of a graphic designer. To think about situations, which haven’t been considered and twist them on a non-linear flat canvas. And even though the surface for the profession of a graphic designer is often the flat, two-dimensional space, this term as a practice can be also interlinked with the ones of a graphic designer. As a designer one is in flux – one that, is adapting to its surroundings and circumstances. Expanding its dimension, opening into all three coordinates. However, thinking in this three-dimensional scale, someone's work can create has the potential to grow and be re-figured into something offering opportunities to study past scenes and movements more precisely.</p>
<h3>Future(s) Speculation</h3>
<p>A viscous black mass and shrill weird tones are introducing <em>The</em> <em>Laughing Snake.</em> Her bulging tale twist around herself. And as the body turns around itself, so do the stories around her.</p>
<p>„Her story is told at every  edge of the world  A jinn no one could elude  One time into the past  and one time into the future “[13]</p>
<p><em>The Laughing Snake</em> is part of Morehshin Allahyari's work <em>She Who Sees The Unknown</em>. A research-based project, in which she uses 3D techniques and storytelling to re-create the story of monstrous female/queer figures of Middle Eastern origin. Their stories often changed over time and narrowed down into a linear string of thoughts. It is about to re-imagine the stories of these figures, to bring back their sparkling personalities and let them tell transmit their knowledge. The 3D environment Allahyari created for the Laughing Snake referred to the myths told around the figure. The body reflects its surroundings, like a mirror. “The only way to kill the snake is to hold a mirror in front of her. When people do so, and the snake sees her own image in the mirror, she starts laughing. She laughs for days and nights until she self-destructs and dies.”[14]</p>
<p>The work <em>The Laughing Snake</em> is confronting the viewer and refers to the reflection of the mirror. The viewer clicks through the story goes back and forth and re-creates each time a new direction of the narrative. There is not only one string of thoughts that the viewer can follow. The non-linearity creates a thin web of possibilities. One time one is in the past and one time one is in the future. Bridging these two times feels like jumping through a portal in which the exit is uncertain every time. There is no ending point because each time it seems you reached the end there is a new entry to a new adventure of discoveries.</p>    </div>

<h2>The new Collectively</h2>
<h3>Aura of an Object</h3>
<p>The metamorphosis of the world brings a constant process and change. This change is not only applicable to society or working methods but also a change in perception. How we sense things is guided by history and its influences. If the political or environmental circumstances force or change the view on how we discern consequently the way how we feel about artwork is remodelled. Thus, an artwork can change its meaning throughout time and space. Especially relocation takes away its authenticity. As Walter Benjamin argues in his essay <em>The Work of Art in the Age of Reproduction</em>, is an object tied to its history through different ownerships or physical conditions, the authenticity is lacking when it gets reproduced. Already with the first touch, an artist is giving character to an object. One is shaping the surface, thinking about form, materiality, and purpose. Each little crack makes the object more alive, makes it more fruitful and tangible.</p>
<p>The materiality of an object transmits meaning. The layering of meshes on top of each other piles up traces. This deep-evolving understanding of the material aspects from which artworks are made is given with high-resolution 3D recordings of sites, monuments, artifacts, etc. Scanning the object from different angles, trying out several techniques to find the right moment to capture all the information it carries with it. And even if new technologies fulfil the desire to bring objects close to us, to depict them right in our homes the reproducing or scanning does not reproduce the authenticity of an object.</p>
<p>Each artifact has its aura some mystical glow around its surface protecting the knowledge of it. It functions as a magnet. It creates a field around it and attracts the contemplator to stop. The aura is difficult to narrow down, but it is bound to its object and thus not reproducible. Walter Benjamin describes the aura of an art object with a natural phenomenon such as the sunset.<a href="notion://www.notion.so/034417efb5504ccc9b3883693861738b?v=0b785f7416004c92afaa19b5e7b6a227&amp;p=5c6f99ba8b5e4a4e82098f258b60ca10#_ftn15">[15]</a> A natural phenomenon that will be always in distance. Not touchable or reachable. Like the placement of art objects in the museum. A place of contemplation.</p>
<p>The metamorphosis of the world brings a constant process and change. Everything is overwriting itself constantly and adapting to different directions. Nowadays, 3d scanning and comparable techniques are part of the non-contact documentation of cultural heritage and the creation of replicas. The lack of quality of a 2d created replica of an art object is not blossoming as the original in detail and flourishing tangibility. No copy can re-materialize the original, but the closer the replica is documented the more accurate the outcome can be. And even if the documentation is so precisely the relocation of the dated information brings new forms of meaning.</p>
<p>This omnipresence is described in Paul Valéry his essay <em>The Conquest of Ubiquity:</em></p>
<p>“Works of art will acquire a kind of ubiquity. We shall only have to summon them and there they will be, either in their living actuality or restored from the past They will not merely exist in themselves but will exist wherever someone with a certain apparatus happens to be. A work of art will cease to be anything more than a kind of source or point of origin whose benefit will be available and quite fully so, wherever we wish.”[16]</p>
<p>He states pretty much the future of art and technology of how we live it nowadays. Nowadays we see screens everywhere.</p>
<p>Ding, Ding.  Your meal is on the way 🙌🏼  Your food from Pizza Chef will arrive in approximately 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Buzz, Buzz.  Your Uber is on the way and will arrive in two minutes.</p>
<p>We are online constantly. Not only to live a smart life but sometimes even to see art — paradoxically not in its physicality. Only existing in the form of small pixels forming the artwork. Holding a tablet device in one's hands an empty black space turns into the Mogao Grottoes—known as the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas. <em>(Pure Land AR, 2012)<strong>[17]</strong></em> The tablet reveals the cave in its full size. By moving around the space, the viewer can discover the architecture of the cave and explore the statues and paintings.</p>
<p>“At first, no doubt, only the reproduction, and transmission of works of art will be affected. It will be possible to send anywhere or to re-create anywhere a system of sensations, or more precisely a system of stimuli, provoked by some object or event in any given place. “[18]</p>
<p>Objects function as archives themselves, they carry “compounded ideas, thoughts, materials, evidence, transactions and the actions of time.”[19] Recording the artifacts can evolve the aura and question the knowledge behind them. Often the digital is connected to the virtual, something which doesn’t exist in its materiality and physically. Like the aura. Technology functions as a portal of the aura. Through digital preservation, the aura is documented and continues further in its new form and space. It inhabits both spaces — the physical and digital.</p>
<p>It’s like diving in the deep sea, falling into a different world. The imagination of what the surrounding looks like is the only thing can rely on. The blackness around one does only grant glimpses of the nearby. The relation towards the objects one discovers in this vicious black mass has changed when the space turns from a flat surface into a three-dimensional object. It becomes more direct, more visual, and emotional. Water Benjamin refers in his Essay to the upcoming of the film but still, his words do also match the upcoming of digital reproductions. “Mechanical reproduction of art changes the reaction of the masses towards art.”[20] It isn’t only a product of contemplation anymore; it is almost real and tangible. The emotion behind the relationship one starts building with the artwork changes. The potency behind the creation of doubles is rich and on the contrary questionable. The trust in what we see or hear shifts and does take more in-depth contextualization of the known. It is paradoxical to think that using a device that is sold to smoothen our daily life brings new challenges with it. On the contrary, it does prove its function of easy access. As Valéy introduces the ubiquity of the artworks he was still describing future scenarios. Replicating objects gives more people access to objects or places that will never leave their country or visitation is prohibited. The only possible entry point is the digital and the replication of it.</p>    </div>
